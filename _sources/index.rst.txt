Mango
=======

For the time being, Mango (previously Vertex Engine) is an early-stage open source 3D graphics framework mostly for proof of concept graphics applications purposes.

However, the aim of this project is to create a game engine with featuring a rendering engine (based on Vulkan API), physics engine, audio and animation systems, that is capable of creating 3D games. The engine is being built with doing a remake of a 3D game that I and my team created during the university time (more on that in the future).

Any constructive comments and improvements are more than welcome.
