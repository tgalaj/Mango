# Vertex Engine
This is an open source 3D graphics engine mostly for proof of concept graphics applications purposes. In the future it may evolve into some kind of a game engine.

## How to build
Make sure to clone the repository with the one of the following commands (to also clone the sources of the dependencies):

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/Shot511/VertexEngine

OR

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Shot511/VertexEngine

OR

git clone --recursive https://github.com/Shot511/VertexEngine
```

If you've already cloned the repo run the following command in the root directory:

```git submodule update --init --recursive```

Then, simply run the following commands in the root directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

These commands will create the project files (inside the *build* directory) with your system-default build system which will allow you to build and run the engine.
